      <h2>USER COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        Connecting with Other Users: We aim to provide a platform and
        marketplace where Users can discover and engage with a wide range of
        artwork, design and other items from around the world, including items
        from the various galleries, institutions and others that use our
        Services as exhibitors or sellers. To help make this happen, our
        Services may include features, such as messaging tools and email
        addresses hosted on our Services, that enable you to contact and
        communicate with other Users. For example, when an auction house,
        gallery, or other seller lists an artwork or other item on our Services,
        our Services may enable you to contact them about that item or about
        other items they may have available.

        email address and (as applicable) other contact information from us to
        facilitate communications, transactions, or for their marketing
        purposes. Sometimes such Users may be able to obtain additional
        information about you when you use our Services to contact them or
        perform a transaction with them. For example, they may be able to obtain
        information about your location, interests and other information, as
        indicated by us in connection with these Services, or as otherwise

        with other Users when you contact them or perform a transaction with
        them, as indicated when you use these Services or in your profile and

      <h2>WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>
        Personal Information. Under this Policy, "Personal Information" means
        information that by itself can be used to identify or contact a specific
        person (for example, a person’s name, email address, postal address or
        phone number), and Personal Information does not include information
        that has been aggregated or made anonymous so that by itself it no
        longer identifies and can no longer reasonably be used to contact a
        specific person. In certain circumstances, Personal Information may also
        include information you voluntarily provide to us such as artists and
        galleries you choose to follow. We will only share your Personal
        Information with others in the ways described in this Policy, or
        otherwise with your prior consent. In addition to the other sharing of

        Personal Information as necessary to perform those functions for us.

        investigation, email and postal mail administration, customer service
        assistance, web and mobile data analytics, display ads, and server and
        database hosting services. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not sell
        your Personal Information to our Service Providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Payment Processing: We use third-parties, including
        Stripe, to gather your data from financial institutions. By using our
        Services, you grant our third-party providers the right, power, and
        authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and
        financial information from the relevant financial institution according
        to terms of such third-party providers' privacy policies and service
        terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Business Transfers: If we are involved in a merger,
        acquisition, or sale of assets, your Personal Information may be one of
        the assets transferred. In this event, if you have registered for an
        Artlinx account, we will notify you of the change of ownership by
        sending an email to the most recent email address you provided us under
        your Artlinx account.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Legal Purposes: We may access, preserve, and
        disclose your Personal Information and/or other information if we
        believe that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
        necessary to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, legal process or
        governmental request (such as search warrants, subpoenas or court
        orders), which may include responding to legal requests from
        jurisdictions outside the United States; (ii) enforce our Terms of Use
        or our other policies or agreements with Users, or investigate potential
        violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security
        or technical issues; (iv) protect or enforce the rights or property of
        Artlinx, you, or any other person or entity; or (v) prevent physical

      <h2>AGGREGATED AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        We may aggregate and/or make anonymous any Personal Information that we
        have obtained in any way from or about you or others so that such
        information no longer contains any Personal Information. We may use and
        share any aggregated, anonymous or other non-personally identifying
        information for any legitimate business purposes, including research and
        development, marketing, and to inform others about how our Services or

        If you use our marketplace or register for certain Services, you may
        need to provide payment information, such as a credit card number, type
        and expiration date. We do not intentionally store credit card
        information entered on our Services. This information is stored by a
        third-party payment processor, and the use and storage of this
        information will be subject to the payment processor’s own terms of
        service and privacy policy. We do receive certain information from the
        payment processor, including a unique token that we associate with you
        to authorize your purchases, and in certain cases, the last four digits
        of the credit card number associated with that token, in order to help
        prevent fraud and identity theft. If you do not wish to provide payment
        information, you will not be able to use certain Services on our Site.

      <h2>CHILDREN’S INFORMATION</h2>

        Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do
        not knowingly collect Personal Information from people in this age
        group. If you believe we may have collected Personal Information from

      <h2>SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        Every Artlinx account is protected by a password to help maintain
        privacy and security on our Services. If you register for an account, we
        urge you to use a strong password containing unique numbers, letters and
        special characters, and to protect the confidentiality of your password
        at all times. If you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized access
        to or use of your account or password, you agree to immediately notify
        us and change your password. Please note that while we seek to protect
        your information and maintain the security of our Services, due to the
        possibility of hardware or software failure, unauthorized entry or use
        and other factors, we cannot guarantee the security of any information,
        whether online or offline. Any transmission of information is at your
        own risk. Please also note that any information you provide to us via
        email is unencrypted.
      </p>
      <h2>STATUTORY REQUESTS</h2>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions have laws that give people the right to access or
        correct their Personal Information which a company has about them. We
        will honor any statutory right you may have to access or correct your
        Personal Information that we have in our records, and you can email such
        requests to artlinx@artlinxdigital.com . Once we receive your request,
        we will let you know if an administrative fee will apply to fulfill your
        request, as permitted by applicable law. However, please note that even
        if you have a legal right to request access to information or to correct
        information, as permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that
        are unreasonably repetitive, would require disproportionate technical
        effort (for example, developing a new system or materially changing an
        existing practice), would jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be
        extremely impractical to fulfill (for example, requests to access
        information located on backup systems).

      <h2>PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide

      </p>
      <p>
        Categories of Personal Information we collect. Throughout this Policy,

        The categories, and some examples of what we may collect, are:

      </p>
      <p>

        about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preference, characteristics,
        psychological trends, preferences, predispositions, behavior, attitudes,
        intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Other Information, e.g., any other information you
        choose to directly provide to us in connection with your use of the
        Services
      </p>
      <p>
        How we use your Personal Information. We use and share the categories of
        Personal Information we collect about you consistent with the various
        business purposes we discuss throughout this Policy, as described in the
        “How we Use the Information we Collect and the Reasons for Doing So” and
        “With Whom do we Share Personal Information?” sections above.
      </p>
      <p>
        CCPA rights disclosure. If you are a California resident, the CCPA
        allows you or an authorized agent on your behalf to make certain
        requests about your Personal Information. Specifically, the CCPA allows
        you or your agent to request:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Right to know. Information about the categories of
        Personal Information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of
        sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for
        collecting your Personal Information; and the categories of third
        parties with whom we share/disclose Personal Information. Such
        information is also set forth in this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Right to access. Provide access to and/or a copy of
        certain information we hold about you and that we have collected about

      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests
        under California law. For example, we need certain information in order
        to provide the Services to you. We also will take reasonable steps to
        verify your identity before responding to a request. You are also
        permitted to designate an authorized agent to subject certain requests
        on your behalf. To verify that your agent has been authorized to make a
        request on your behalf, we may require them to provide us with a signed
        written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right to non-discrimination. The CCPA further provides you with the
        right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable
        law) for exercising your rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information. If you are a

        from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of
        Personal Information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third

      <h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        Our business changes with time, and our Privacy Policy will change also.
        We reserve the right to change this Policy, including our Cookie Policy,
        without prior notice, at any time at our sole discretion. For example,
        and without limitation, we may change this Policy to reflect changes to
        the law or changes to our Services. All changes to this Policy will be
        effective when posted on our Services, or at such later date as may be
        specified in the updated Policy. We will notify you of any changes to
        this Policy by posting the updated Policy on our Services, and you agree
        to review this Policy regularly and inform yourself of all applicable
        changes. By continuing to use our Services after any changes to this

        Policy. Unless we notify you otherwise, the current version of this
        Policy will apply to all information that we have about you or your
        account.
      </p>
      <h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies: We may use cookies, web
        beacons and similar technologies, such as tracking URLs, to collect
        information about how you or others access or engage with our Services,
        Content, emails, and ads displayed on or off our Services, and to
        operate, develop, improve, and customize our Services, Content, and
        marketing, including ads displayed on or off our Services. Most browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but your browser may have settings that
        enable you to decline or delete cookies on your device. Please note that
        if you decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in, customize, or
        use some of the interactive features of our Services, as some of our
        Services require cookies to operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        What these Technologies Are: “Cookies” are small data files placed on
        your computer or other device which record information. For example, a
        cookie could enable our Services to recognize your browser, while
        another cookie could store your account preferences and other
        information to help make our Services more customized. We may use two
        kinds of cookies, “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session
        cookies normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent
        cookies remain on your device until they expire or are deleted. “Web
        beacons” (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFS”) are pieces of code
        or pixels embedded in a web page or email to track engagement with and
        responses to emails, web pages or ads, or to access or communicate with
        cookies. “Tracking URLs” are special URLs that can be used to track
        engagement with and responses to emails or web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-Party Analytics, Service, and Ad Providers: We may use third-party
        analytics and services providers who help us to better understand how
        our Services and Content are accessed and used, including for web
        analytics, audience measurement, personalization and segmentation, and
        relationship management purposes. In turn, this information helps us to
        develop and improve our Services and Content. Our third-party analytics
        and service providers include but are not limited to Google Analytics.
        These providers may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to
        collect information about how Users access or engage with our Services,
        Content, emails, and ads on or off our Services. For more information
        about how Google may collect and process information in connection with
        Google Analytics, click here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use third-party advertising providers, including ad networks
        or exchanges, to help display ads on our Services or on other websites,
        including customized ads based on past online activity. These third
        parties may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to help
        provide their services to us, and to collect information about your and
        others’ online activity across different websites. These providers may
        also collect your IP address, device identifier, or identifier for
        advertising (IDFA). The third-party advertising providers we use include
        but are not limited to Google Analytics, and we use its Remarketing and
        Demographics and Interest Reporting features, which enables Google
        Analytics to collect data about traffic on our Services through Google
        advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. We and third-party
        providers, including Google Analytics, may use first-party cookies (i.e.
        cookies set by the website you are visiting) and third-party cookies
        (i.e. cookies set by a thirdparty website other than the website you are
        visiting) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our
        Services. We do not control the practices of any third-party providers,
        and this Cookie Policy (and our Privacy Policy in general) does not
        cover the use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by any
        third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opting-Out: Third-party providers may offer you a way to opt-out of
        receiving cookies from them by visiting their own websites or the
        websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative
        and the Digital Advertising Alliance. For example, you may opt-out of
        receiving ad-related cookies from Google through its Ad Settings. If you
        opt-out of receiving cookies from one of these providers, it may place a
        cookie on your device to remember your preference. For more information
        about AdChoice, please visit their website. Accordingly, if you delete
        cookies, install a new browser, or start using a new device, you may
        need to repeat the opt-out process. To opt out of receiving any
        marketing materials, please email us at artlinx@artlinxdigital.com .
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes to this Cookie Policy: As this Cookie Policy is part of our
        Privacy Policy, we may update it at any time as described in our Privacy
        Policy. Please review this Cookie Policy regularly to be informed of any
        updates.
